Given the conversation history below, rewrite the user's latest message as a single self-contained search query. The query should:

1. Replace all pronouns, references, and ellipsis with their concrete antecedents from the conversation.
2. Be a clear, standalone question or search phrase that makes sense without any prior context.
3. Preserve the user's original intent — do not add, remove, or change the meaning.

Return ONLY the reformulated query, nothing else.
