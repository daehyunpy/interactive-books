    <h1>Chapter 1: Introduction</h1>
    <p>This is a sample HTML book used for testing the ingestion pipeline. It contains simple paragraphs and headings to verify that the HTML parser correctly extracts text content.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>The interactive books project supports multiple file formats. HTML is one of the supported formats, parsed as a single logical page.</p>

    <h1>Chapter 2: Details</h1>
    <p>This chapter covers additional details about the project. The chunker will split this content into appropriately sized pieces for embedding and retrieval.</p>

    <p>Each paragraph contributes to the overall text that gets indexed for search.</p>
